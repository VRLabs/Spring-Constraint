## How it works

The constraint is weighted between 3 sources to achieve a spring-like effect.

## How to use

Replace the Cube under "Container" with your own objects.

To change the characteristics of the spring, change the position constraint values on the "Motion" object.

Sources > Spring Target (default 1.1) controls the strength of the spring. Higher values make it harder to stretch the spring. Min: 1, Max: 2

Sources > Motion (default 4) dampens acceleration, the higher the value the slower "Container" accelerates.
